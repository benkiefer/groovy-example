# A Groovy Example

This project is just a couple of simple modules to help someone new to Groovy get started. There are three modules that will be of interest:

 - Intro: code examples of some of the language level features that I've found most helpful in Groovy.
 - Homework (forthcoming): a way to test that you really understand what is going on in the Intro module.
 - Scripts (forthcoming): not really a module, but a folder containing a couple of simple Groovy scripts that you can play around with.

All code examples are tested against Groovy 2.0.6.
