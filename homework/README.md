# Homework

The "org.burgers.groovy.homework" module contains several JUnit test files to help reinforce the content from the intro module and help you become more familiar with Groovy's APIs. All solutions are located in the "org.burgers.groovy.solutions" package in a file of the same name.

You can work through each test individually by removing the "@Ignore" annotation from each test.

Good luck!
